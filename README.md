## Description

This repo hosts a simple script for converting a cvs file into datacards to be used with the [Higgs Combination tool](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit#How_to_run_the_tool).  The output a set of datacards that represent one bin for various types of analysis strategies.  These can be found in mGluion1600/*fb/.  The different directories are the same thing, just scale to a specific lumininosity scenario.  Its very likely that his can be done with combine, but I didn't bother to find out how :(

## Commands to run

### Combined datacard (merging all bins)

### Expected upper limit

### Expected Significance
